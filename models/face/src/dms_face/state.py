"""
Within-subsystem channel fusion → StateReport.

Combines four independent channels into one reported state:

    prolonged closure  (fast,  seconds)     -- microsleep, fires immediately
    PERCLOS            (slow,  60 s window) -- gradual fatigue
    blink character    (medium)             -- lengthening blinks
    head pose + gaze   (fast)               -- distraction

The channels are deliberately independent. PERCLOS is a lagging indicator by
construction and is weakest at early-stage sleepiness, so the closure and blink
channels exist to cover the window it misses. Conversely PERCLOS catches slow
drooping that never becomes a discrete "closure event".

Monorepo boundary: this is *not* DMS decision fusion. That layer will consume
`StateReport` (scores + quality + reasons) alongside physiology and phone
outputs and own the cabin alert. `should_alert` is a demo convenience for
`run.py`; production policy must not hard-wire to it.
